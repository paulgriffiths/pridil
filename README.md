What is it?
-----------

**Pridil** is a prisoner's dilemma evolution simulator inspired by Robert
Axelrod's "The Evolution of Cooperation" (1984) and the interest it kindled.

The problem underlying the prisoner's dilemma was originally framed by Merrill
Flood and Melvin Dreshner in 1950, and refers to a situation where two parties,
in the absence of knowledge about the other party's intention, are motivated
not to cooperate with each other when following a rational self-interest,
even though both parties would benefit more by mutual cooperation.

The interest from an evolutionary perspective comes from examining how
individuals fare when they follow a pre-programmed strategy for interacting
within the "game", rather than following a rational self-interest. On the
grounds that cooperation is mutually beneficial but individually not rational,
and under the assumption that the benefits from any such cooperation may be
expected to result in reproductive success and the proliferation of genes
responsible for such a strategy, such an examination may shed light on how
a tendency to cooperate can be evolutionarily stable and successful despite
the fact that such a strategy may not be rational from an individual
perspective.
