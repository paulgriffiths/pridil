# This is a basic configuration file for the Prisoner's Dilemma
# simulator. Use the -c or --configfile options from the command line,

#
#   pridil -cpridil-config
#
# or:
#
#   pridil --configfile=pridil-config
#
# Lines starting with a '#' character (like this one) are comments, and

# Creatures
# =========
#
# Use these settings to initially populate the world with creatures having
# the listed strategies. The default is zero for any not provided.

# World options
# =============
#
# - 'default_life_expectancy' is given in days. Each creature plays one
#    game each day (unless there are an odd number of creatures, in which
#    case one random creature will not play a game that day)
# - 'default_life_expectancy_range' is given in days, and represents a
#    range around default_life_expectancy within which a given creature's
#    actual life expectancy can randomly vary.
# - 'default_starting_resources' is given in nominal resource units, each
#    creature will start its life with this quantity of resources, which
#    may increase or decrease as a result of each game.
# - 'days_to_run' is given in days. The simulation will run for this
#    number of days.
# - 'repro_cost' is given in nominal resource units, each creature will
#    lose this quantity of resources when it reproduces, and its offspring
#    will begin its life with this quantity of resources
# - 'repro_min_resources' is given in nominal resource units, each creature
#    must have this quantity of resources before it can reproduce, to
#    ensure that it has a reasonable quantity of resources after it
#    reproduces and "donates" some of its resources to its offspring.
# - 'repro_cycle_days' is given in days, and represents the length
#    of the reproduction cycle, e.g. if set to 10 then every 10 days
#    a creature will reproduce it its resources exceed the minimum.
# - 'disable deaths' is equivalent to the -D command line flag.
# - 'disable reproduction' is equivalent to the -R command line flag.
