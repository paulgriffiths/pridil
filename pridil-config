# This is a basic configuration file for the Prisoner's Dilemma
# simulator. Use the -c or --configfile options from the command line,
# e.g.:
#
#   pridil -cpridil-config
#
# or:
#
#   pridil --configfile=pridil-config
#
# Lines starting with a '#' character (like this one) are comments, and
# are ignored. Blank lines are also ignored. 


# Creatures
# =========
#
# Use these settings to initially populate the world with creatures having
# the listed strategies. The default is zero for any not provided.

# World options
# =============
#
# - 'default_life_expectancy' is given in days. Each creature plays one
#    game each day (unless there are an odd number of creatures, in which
#    case one random creature will not play a game that day)
# - 'default_life_expectancy_range' is given in days, and represents a
#    range around default_life_expectancy within which a given creature's
#    actual life expectancy can randomly vary.
# - 'default_starting_resources' is given in nominal resource units, each
#    creature will start its life with this quantity of resources, which
#    may increase or decrease as a result of each game.
# - 'days_to_run' is given in days. The simulation will run for this
#    number of days.

# Display options
# ===============
#
# 'summary resources' shows summarized resource statistics by creature

# 'summary creatures' shows summarized statistics for each creature,

# 'detailed memories' shows detailed memories for each creature, equivalent
# to the '-d' command line flag.
